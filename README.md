Following the principal learning by doing, this Pokedex App was built to get a better understanding of javascript.
Creating this app was part of my [CF Full-Stack Web Development Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/).

Live Demo [here](https://almanowski.github.io/pokedex-app/).
